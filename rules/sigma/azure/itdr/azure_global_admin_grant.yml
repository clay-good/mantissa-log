id: itdr-azure-global-admin-grant-001
status: stable
description: |
  Detects when Global Administrator role is assigned in Azure AD/Entra ID.
  Global Administrator is the highest privilege role in Azure AD with
  full control over the tenant. Any assignment of this role should be
  extremely rare and heavily scrutinized.

  Threat actors frequently target this role for persistence and lateral
  movement in cloud environments.
