title: Duo Security Anomalous Push Authentication
id: 1f020fi8-mp1t-4s8p-qt4s-9r3t5u7s8t9r
status: stable
description: |
    Detects authentication events where push notification was used but marked
    as anomalous by Duo's risk engine. This may indicate MFA fatigue attacks
    or push bombing where attackers repeatedly send push requests hoping the
    user will accept.
